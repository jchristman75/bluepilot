"""Ford RCM yaw-sensor health check.

Some Ford RCMs broadcast implausible yaw rate (e.g. sign-inverted vs the IMU and the
steering geometry) while the signal's quality flag still reads OK. Since the stock
safety firmware and control code measure curvature from this yaw signal, a bad sensor
shows up as "steering limit exceeded" alerts at 20-35 mph and weak curve tracking.

This tool answers "is MY yaw sensor healthy?" from any drive's logs:
  - yaw_geo:  yaw rate implied by the steering angle via the vehicle model (reference)
  - yaw_can:  the RCM yaw rate the car broadcasts (what stock openpilot trusts)
  - yaw_imu:  the comma device gyro (independent cross-check)

A healthy sensor tracks the steering geometry in BOTH correlation AND gain:
corr(yaw_can, yaw_geo) > +0.9 with a median ratio near +1.0. The failure mode measured
on a faulty 2021 Explorer RCM was unstable gain -- across five months the ratio wandered
+0.42 / +0.45 / +0.62 / +0.71 / +0.92 / +1.80 / +2.11 (including two drives on the SAME
day at +2.11 and +0.45), with high positive correlation throughout -- which corrupts the
curvature measurement just as badly as a sign flip (a 2x gain error at curvature 0.005
is 2.5x the safety check's whole error band). A negative correlation (sign inversion)
is also broken. Because the gain wanders BETWEEN drives and occasionally passes through
+1.0 (a known-broken sensor measured +0.92 on one drive), ALWAYS run this on two or
three different routes: a ratio that moves is itself the fault signature.

Usage:
  tools/ford_yaw_health_check.py '<dongleid>|<route>'
  (works with rlogs; for qlog fallback append the LogReader qlog selector to the route)
